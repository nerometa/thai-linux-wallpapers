Collection of wallpapers from Linux Thai and TLWG (Thai Linux Working Group) communities.

This is mostly a hobby project. More wallpapers will be available over time. Maybe from me, or from the communities.

All wallpapers I made are in 4K. I just started to learn how to use GIMP, and also GitHub. So this will be a perfect opportunity to learn both skills.
